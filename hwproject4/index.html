    <p>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet</p><p> To go over everything</p><p>They say that time's supposed to heal ya</p><p>But I ain't done much healing</p>
    <p>Hello, can you hear me?</p>I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be</p><p>When we were younger and free</p><p>I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet</p>
    <p>There's such a difference between us</p><p>And a <span>million<span> miles<p>
